  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    I am a first-year Master of Public Informatics student 
    at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public 
    Policy at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I have a B.S. 
    in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at 
    Austin where I specialized in data science and signal processing. 
    I did many projects as an undergraduate that applied data science 
    and engineering to community needs, and now I'm passionate about 
    using data science tools to inform social policy solutions.
